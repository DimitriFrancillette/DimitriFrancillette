## Hello it's Dimitri ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m transitioning into web development after completing intensive training at O'Clock and La Capsule.<br><br>

- ðŸ”§ Iâ€™ve gained solid experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React framework, working on real-world projects to hone my skills. My passion for development drives me to continuously learn and improve, and I love tackling new challenges in programming.<br><br>
  
- ðŸš€ *Iâ€™m currently looking for my first opportunity as a **junior frontend web developer***, where I can contribute to exciting projects, collaborate with experienced teams, and further develop my technical abilities.<br><br>
